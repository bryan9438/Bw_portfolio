          Hello! My name is Bryan currently based in Reading, UK. I graduated from Torrens University, Sydney,
          Australia with a BA degree in Hospitality and Event Management. After a few years of working in the hospitality industry,
          I realised my passion is more towards web design and technology and therefore Iâ€™ve decided to join the Le Wagon Bootcamp
          to pursue further studies ! Although the coding Bootcamp only lasted for 10 weeks, during this amazing and intensive journey
          I have learned a lot including the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, javascript, bootstrap, SQLite, Figma, ruby on rails, and last
          but not least using Heroku to deploy our projects. Never the less, I have also pursue further studies in jQuery and React with
          Coursera to prepare myself into the industry.
